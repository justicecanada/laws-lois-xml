list-item="no"><Text>Whereas the Governor in Council considers that retail local access-dependent VoIP services are typically indistinguishable from traditional local telephone services, while retail local access-independent VoIP services are very different, as they require high-speed Internet access as well as special handsets, adapters or the use of a computer, and may be more susceptible to service deterioration or disruption;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09" lims:fid="726345" lims:id="726345" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes"

telecommunications policy objectives set out in section 7 of the Act include enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness, at the national and international levels, of Canadian telecommunications, fostering increased reliance on market forces for the provision of telecommunications services, ensuring that regulation, where required, is efficient and effective, stimulating research and development in Canada in the field of telecommunications and encouraging innovation in the provision of telecommunications services;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09"

of smaller players in the local telephone market;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09" lims:fid="726349" lims:id="726349" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes"

list-item="no"><Text>Whereas the Governor in Council considers that it would be consistent with the Canadian telecommunications policy objectives to refrain from regulating the retail local access-independent class of VoIP services provided by the ILECs within their incumbent territories, at this time, since forbearance from economic regulation for those services would stimulate competition and innovation;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09" lims:fid="726352" lims:id="726352" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes"

the Decision;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09" lims:fid="726353" lims:id="726353" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>And, whereas, in accordance with section 13 of the Act, the Minister of Industry has notified the minister designated by the government of each province of the Minister’s intention to make his recommendation to the Governor in Council to vary the Decision and has provided an opportunity for each minister to consult with him;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-11-09" lims:fid="726354" lims:id="726354" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Therefore, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, pursuant to subsection 12(7) of the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="T-3.4">Telecommunications Act</XRefExternal>, varies Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28, as amended by Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28-1 and as confirmed in Telecom Decision CRTC 2006-53, so that, in relation to retail local access-independent VoIP services – being a particular class of services – provided by ILECs within their incumbent territories, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission refrain from exercising its powers and performing its duties under section 25, subsections 27(1), (5) and (6) and sections 29 and 31 of that Act to the same extent that it does in relation to retail local telecommunications services provided to end users by CLECs in Telecom Decision CRTC 97-8, <XRefExternal reference-type="other">Local Competition</XRefExternal>, and subsequent determinations. However, nothing in this Order prevents the Commission from exercising its powers and resuming regulation of retail local access-independent VoIP services provided by ILECs within their incumbent territories if, pursuant to subsection 34(3) of that Act, it finds, as a question of fact, that circumstances have changed so that to continue to refrain would be likely to impair unduly the establishment or continuance of a competitive market for the provision of those services. Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28, as amended by Telecom Decision CRTC 2005-28-1 and as confirmed in Telecom Decision CRTC 2006-53, shall otherwise continue to apply, but to the extent that its provisions are inconsistent with this Order, they shall be interpreted so that the provisions of this Order prevail.</Text></Provision></Order></Regulation>
