Beluga whales are characterized by having stout bodies, well defined necks and a disproportionately small head. They have thick skins, short but broad paddle shaped flippers, sharp teeth, and, unlike other whales, do not have a dorsal fin. Belugas average three to five metres in length and weigh between 500 and 1000 kilograms. Beluga whales live in cold Arctic waters, travelling from habitat to habitat. Its movements are driven by the need for ice free water and sufficient quantities of food. In winter, the beluga whale is found in areas of open water; in summer it frequents shallow bays and estuaries.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612241" lims:id="612241" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) states that available evidence supports dividing the Canadian belugas into seven populations, based on largely disjunct summer distributions and genetic differences. Five of these populations are currently under consideration for listing under the Act, including Cumberland Sound, Eastern High Arctic/Baffin Bay, Eastern Hudson Bay, Ungava Bay, and Western Hudson Bay populations. Historical commercial hunting has been the main cause of the declines in some populations, although belugas are also threatened by natural factors including ice entrapments and predators such as polar bears and killer whales. A variety of other human activities may also put beluga whales at risk, including noise and disturbance resulting from vessel traffic, climate change, contaminants and hydro-electric dams.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612242" lims:id="612242" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The management of beluga whale populations in Canada is regulated by the <XRefExternal reference-type="regulation" link="SOR-93-56">Marine Mammal Regulations</XRefExternal> under the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal>. For those populations that are harvested for subsistence purposes, quotas are set through co-management boards based on scientific data and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge. Inuit people harvest some individuals for social, ceremonial/cultural, and subsistence purposes. Harvesting is done in the context of conservation of the species, where hunting will not jeopardize the survival or recovery of the populations. In fact, Inuit people have been instrumental in contributing to management plans and recovery strategies for the beluga populations and their ongoing collaboration will be essential for the continued stability and recovery of all the populations.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612243" lims:id="612243" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Not adding these five populations of the beluga whale at this time is necessary in order to further consult with the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board.

Adults can attain a size of about 3.2 metres, and have an average life expectancy of 30 to 40 years. Porbeagle sharks occur on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the south Pacific and Indian Oceans. COSEWIC has identified fishing mortality as the main threat to this species. In Canada, porbeagle sharks are currently harvested in a directed fishery, managed under the Canadian Atlantic Pelagic Shark Integrated Fisheries Management Plan, and as bycatch in the Atlantic Canadian large pelagics and groundfish fisheries. They are also harvested by other countries.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612247" lims:id="612247" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>In the absence of a provision that allows for the possession and trade of listed species in certain circumstances, listing the porbeagle under the Act would eliminate the directed porbeagle fishery and also prohibit the sale and trade of porbeagle shark that is by-caught in other fisheries. This would result in economic losses for some fishers and associated industries in coastal communities and loss of industry-based sources of information on the species. If listed porbeagle shark cannot be sold, costs (net present value over a twenty-year time frame) to the fishing industry would range from $0.8 million to $1.8 million, with an additional potential loss of $0.7 million in regional spin off effects. Costs associated with population monitoring surveys may be as high as $50,000 per year in the absence of the fishery. Listing of the porbeagle under the Act would result in unreported discard mortality in fisheries where porbeagle is captured incidentally, which would further hinder scientific efforts to monitor and assess its status.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612248" lims:id="612248" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The federal government will continue to manage porbeagle under the authority of the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal>.

Sturgeons consist of several species that historically occurred throughout the temperate northern hemisphere, which have in recent years declined substantially due to various human induced impacts. Spawning populations of the white sturgeon occur only in the Fraser, Columbia, and Sacramento River systems on the Pacific coast of North America. These populations are genetically distinct from each other and each consists of several genetically distinct sub-populations. Six of these subpopulations have a Canadian range: four in the Fraser River system (Lower, Middle, and Upper Fraser populations as well as the Nechako River population) and two in the Columbia River system (Upper Columbia River and Kootenay River populations).</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612252" lims:id="612252" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>COSEWIC has identified habitat degradation and loss through dams, impoundments, channelization, diking, pollution, illegal fishing and bycatch in fisheries as threats to the species.

This fishery is a key source of information to both monitor and to manage white sturgeon, and provides a means for governments, the recreational fishing industry and conservation groups to work together to conserve and recover this species. Listing these two populations under the Act could lead to between $2.1 million and $9.3 million in annual losses to the recreational fishery sector. As well, the Lower Fraser River and Middle Fraser River populations of the white sturgeon are harvested as bycatch by First Nations during their food, social, and ceremonial fisheries for salmon. For both populations, there is currently a voluntary release of white sturgeon bycatch by First Nations. However, listing these populations could lead to further restrictions on salmon fishing by First Nations.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-09-06" lims:fid="612256" lims:id="612256" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Many conservation measures are already in place to protect and conserve the Lower Fraser River and Middle Fraser River populations of the white sturgeon.

With the federal government’s cooperation, the province of British Columbia has led recovery planning over several years.
