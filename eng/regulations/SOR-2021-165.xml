While damages may be awarded for negligence, incompetence can give rise to the additional sanction of disciplinary action.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303743" lims:id="1303743" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text>In deciding whether the agent has employed the requisite degree of knowledge and skill in a particular matter, relevant factors that are to be taken into account are</Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303744" lims:id="1303744" first-line-indent="1" language-align="no" list-item="yes" pointsize="8" subsequent-line-indent="1"><Label>(a)</Label><Text>the complexity and specialized nature of the matter;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303745" lims:id="1303745" first-line-indent="1" language-align="no" list-item="yes" pointsize="8" subsequent-line-indent="1"><Label>(b)</Label><Text>the agent’s general experience;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303746" lims:id="1303746" first-line-indent="1" language-align="no" list-item="yes" pointsize="8" subsequent-line-indent="1"><Label>(c)</Label><Text>the agent’s training and experience in the technical field and applicable patent and trademark law;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303747" lims:id="1303747" first-line-indent="1" language-align="no" list-item="yes" pointsize="8" subsequent-line-indent="1"><Label>(d)</Label><Text>the preparation and study that the agent was able to dedicate to the matter; and</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303748" lims:id="1303748" first-line-indent="1" language-align="no" list-item="yes" pointsize="8" subsequent-line-indent="1"><Label>(e)</Label><Text>whether it would have been appropriate or feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, an agent of established competence in the field in question.</Text></Provision></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303749" lims:id="1303749" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text>An agent who practises alone or operates a branch office or a part-time office must ensure that all matters requiring an agent’s professional skill and judgment are dealt with directly by an agent qualified to do the work.</Text></Provision></Provision><Heading lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-24" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303750" lims:id="1303750" level="1"><Label>PART 2</Label><TitleText>Confidentiality</TitleText></Heading><Heading lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-24" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303751" lims:id="1303751" level="2"><TitleText>Principle</TitleText></Heading><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303752" lims:id="1303752" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes"><Text>An agent has a duty to preserve the confidences and secrets of their clients.</Text></Provision><RegulationPiece lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303753" lims:id="1303753"><Heading lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-24" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303754" lims:id="1303754" level="2"><TitleText>Rule 2</TitleText></Heading><Section lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:lastAmendedDate="2021-06-28" lims:fid="1303755" lims:id="1303755"><Label>1</Label><Text>An agent must hold in strict confidence all information concerning the business and affairs of the client acquired in the course of the professional relationship and must not disclose such information unless the disclosure is expressly or impliedly authorized by the client, required by law or by order of a court or otherwise permitted or required by this Code.</Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303756" lims:id="1303756" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text><Emphasis style="bold">COMMENTARY</Emphasis></Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303757" lims:id="1303757" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text>In order to facilitate open communication between client and agent, it is important that the client feel completely secure that such communication will be held in strict confidence by the agent.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1303758" lims:id="1303758" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text>This rule must be distinguished from the statutory rule of privilege concerning oral or documentary communications between the client and the agent.

The governing principle is that the agent must protect the client’s interests to the best of the agent’s ability and must not desert the client at a critical stage of a matter or at a time when withdrawal would put the client in a position of disadvantage. As a general rule, the client must be given sufficient time to retain and instruct a replacement agent, including filing an appointment of agent in the relevant CIPO office. Every effort must be made to ensure that withdrawal occurs at an appropriate time in the prosecution of an application, in keeping with the agent’s obligations. The relevant CIPO office, opposing parties, foreign agents and any others directly affected by the withdrawal must also be notified of the withdrawal.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2021-06-28" lims:enacted-date="2021-06-24" lims:fid="1304037" lims:id="1304037" format-ref="indent-0-0" pointsize="8"><Text>Unless a client consents, an agent must not summarily and unexpectedly withdraw their services from that client in order to avoid a conflict arising from accepting a new second client.

However, the final decision rests with the client and the agents who are no longer retained by that client must act in accordance with the principles set out in this rule and, in particular, must try to minimize expense and avoid prejudice to the client.
