It was assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as a threatened species in 2002 based on population declines. The Bocaccio, while not being targeted by any fishery, is captured as non-directed catch in commercial, recreational and First Nations fisheries. COSEWIC identified fishing as the primary threat to the species even though it is not a target species, since it cannot adjust to rapid changes in pressure, causing all individuals brought to the surface to die. The Puget Sound/Georgia Basin population of Bocaccio is listed as endangered under the US <XRefExternal reference-type="act">Endangered Species Act</XRefExternal> (April, 2010), although the US population may be increasing since catch levels were reduced. The current status of the Bocaccio population in Canada is within the critical zone according to the reference points established under the precautionary approach of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616936" lims:id="616936" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The prohibitions under section 32 of SARA, which come into effect after listing a species as threatened or endangered, require that any activity that would result in killing, harming, harassing, capturing or taking an individual of the listed species be stopped immediately. This would include any fishing and subsequent buying or selling of the listed species, if Bocaccio is caught as bycatch while listed as threatened or endangered. The negative socio-economic impacts of adding the Bocaccio to the List would be significant. A 45% reduction in the harvest of the target species would be required in order to reduce the incidental catch of Bocaccio to 50 metric tons (t), which would facilitate the population recovery of this species. Reducing the harvest to 50 t would result in considerable costs, with annual profit losses to the commercial harvest sector in the range of $27.5M. This would, in turn, have a distributional impact on income, jobs and GDP. A reduction of 45% in the harvest would affect 700 jobs in the fishery and result in a $40.5M loss in GDP and $24.5M loss in household income, all in the first year.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616937" lims:id="616937" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Therefore, DFO will continue to manage this species under the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal>. Industry will still bear the costs of harvest reductions, but the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will have the discretion to undertake alternative short-term mitigation measures — such as reduced total allowable catch (TAC), 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring, full catch accountability and monitoring for relative abundance to ensure that total non-directed catch does not increase — that will allow groundfish fisheries to continue in exceptional circumstances. This will avoid early in-season closures of the groundfish fishery, although the frequency with which such closures might be required is not clear. Using the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal> in the management of this species allows for significant variability in biomass, industry engagement and co-management, integrated management plans and the ability to manage Bocaccio within an integrated broader strategy for all Pacific rockfish. Accordingly, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has advised the Minister of the Environment not to recommend adding the Bocaccio to the List.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616938" lims:id="616938" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>In response to conservation and management concerns with respect to groundfish resources on the Pacific coast, DFO initiated discussions with commercial and other groundfish harvesters.

As a result, the fishing industry progressively shifted from targeting Bocaccio to incidentally capturing it while going after a main fishery and is also now actively trying to avoid the incidental catch of Bocaccio. A voluntary relinquishment program for Bocaccio was introduced to prevent further population decline and improve prospects for a recovery of the population. The commercial groundfish industry has been successful in achieving voluntary harvest reductions through adaptive modifications of fishing practices in order to avoid areas where densities of Bocaccio are found to be high. Efforts towards further reductions are underway. Harvest has been reduced to 150 t or lower (120 t in 2006/07; 150 t in 2007/08; 121 t in 2008/09), from the earlier level of 200 t to 300 t.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616942" lims:id="616942" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>By permanently adopting the Commercial Groundfish Integration Pilot Program, DFO will continue to monitor the catch of Bocaccio by the commercial groundfish sector to ensure catches do not increase.

In addition, multi-species surveys have been introduced to monitor relative abundance, to ensure that 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring of all catch is in force, to ensure 100% retention of rockfish, to monitor individual quotas and transferability of quotas between all commercial ground fish licences, and to require full catch accountability by all commercial ground fish harvesters.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616944" lims:id="616944" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>As well, improved catch monitoring will be established to better estimate the level of mortality of Bocaccio in the recreational and First Nations fisheries to ensure that non-directed catch levels do not increase. In particular, a review of the recreational groundfish creel program will be conducted to estimate the recreational catch for the upcoming year. This review will be used to inform recommendations for an improved catch monitoring program for the recreational sector. In addition, DFO is working co-operatively with First Nations to develop new tools for reporting catch information from food, social and ceremonial fisheries. Current harvest from these sectors is not considered to impact recovery of the species.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616945" lims:id="616945" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>New actions to further address the threat to Bocaccio take account of the permanency of the Commercial Groundfish Integration Pilot Program, which includes</Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616946" lims:id="616946" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(a)</Label><Text>100% at-sea monitoring of all catch;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616947" lims:id="616947" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(b)</Label><Text>100% dockside monitoring of all catch;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616948" lims:id="616948" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(c)</Label><Text>100% retention of rockfish;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616949" lims:id="616949" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(d)</Label><Text>individual quotas;</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616950" lims:id="616950" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(e)</Label><Text>transferability of quotas between all commercial groundfish licences; and</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616951" lims:id="616951" first-line-indent="1" subsequent-line-indent="3" list-item="yes" language-align="no"><Label>(f)</Label><Text>individual catch accountability (under which harvesters must acquire a quota for all catch for species with a TAC and quotas).</Text></Provision></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2011-06-23" lims:fid="616952" lims:id="616952" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The outcome of these new measures is expected to allow for the improved catch monitoring for all groundfish species, whether through directed or non-directed fisheries.

Following extensive consideration and analysis, DFO has concluded that this animal is not a distinct physa species and is therefore ineligible to be added to the List . The meeting proceedings (CSAS 2009/004) indicated that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the Lake Winnipeg Physa was a distinct taxonomic unit. Most participants agreed that the Lake Winnipeg Physa was a local variety of a species of snail common to Lake Winnipeg and not considered to be at risk. Considering this lack of clarity concerning the taxonomy of the animal, it is premature to contemplate adding it to the List . Protecting areas where the Lake Winnipeg Physa is present (prohibiting or limiting development under sections 32 and 33 of SARA) could impact development proposals of the shoreline (including residential cottage use), and agricultural, forestry and hydroelectric industries, as well as municipalities and other effluent producing activities. However, causal links to mortality must be established before costs can be accurately estimated.</Text></Provision></Provision></Schedule></Regulation>
