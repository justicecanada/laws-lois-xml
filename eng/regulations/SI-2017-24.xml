Furthermore, some of the other contracting parties to ICCAT do not have the comprehensive tagging and dockside monitoring requirements that the Canadian fishery has and, therefore, reallocated quota may not be as tightly monitored. Additionally, the Canadian fishery provides key indexes of abundance for the assessment of the stock, which would be lost if the fishery were discontinued.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631074" lims:id="631074" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Since the publication of the assessment and status report of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (“COSEWIC”) in 2011, the ABT population has been re-evaluated by ICCAT and a full stock assessment was undertaken in 2014. Based on this most recent assessment, ICCAT noted that the western stock has been increasing in recent years, and the biomass is projected to continue to increase under current catches (2015 global TAC: 2 000 t).</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631075" lims:id="631075" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>If the species is not listed under SARA, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will continue to manage, under the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal>, the recommended annual TAC allocated by ICCAT. It will implement a set of management measures to address the needs of the species, in particular through prioritizing the drafting of an updated Integrated Fisheries Management Plan that is consistent, to the extent possible, with the national Sustainable Fisheries Framework (“SFF”); will undertake a risk assessment of current catch monitoring for each of the existing fleets that harvest ABT; will review at-sea observer coverage levels in the fleets that interact with ABT and will review existing monitoring documents to identify necessary amendments or additions to improve data collection in both the directed and incidental-catch fisheries. This may lead to more accurate post-release mortality estimates and additional ecological benefits due to increased knowledge of the species and its interaction with the ecosystem.</Text></Provision></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631076" lims:id="631076" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text><Emphasis style="bold">Yellowmouth Rockfish (<Language xml:lang="la">Sebastes reedi</Language>)</Emphasis></Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631077" lims:id="631077" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>The Minister of the Environment has recommended, on the advice of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, that the Yellowmouth Rockfish not be added to the List set out in Schedule 1 to SARA</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631078" lims:id="631078" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Adding the species to the List would result in significant and immediate negative socio-economic impacts on industry due to the triggering of the general prohibitions and the incremental benefits would likely be small.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2017-04-13" lims:fid="631079" lims:id="631079" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>If it is not listed under SARA, the Yellowmouth Rockfish will continue to be managed under the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal> as part of the integrated groundfish fishery.

Additional management measures will be implemented to enhance existing mechanisms, including more frequent updates to stock assessments to enable timely implementation of management measures under the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="F-14">Fisheries Act</XRefExternal>. As the current harvest is 1% of the current biomass and the Yellowmouth Rockfish is considered to be in the healthy zone of the SFF, no changes to the TAC are proposed at this time. If the population falls below the healthy zone, the TAC will be adjusted based on updated scientific information. These management measures can achieve the conservation outcomes associated with the species.</Text></Provision></Provision><HistoricalNote><HistoricalNoteSubItem lims:inforce-start-date="2019-08-21" lims:enacted-date="2019-08-07" lims:fid="1197652" lims:id="1197652">SI/2019-81, s. 1(F)</HistoricalNoteSubItem></HistoricalNote></Schedule></Regulation>
