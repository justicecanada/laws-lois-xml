The status report further states that, at present, no Canadian plains bison population is infected with any disease that jeopardizes its existence. As of 2003, there were approximately 600,000 to 720,000 plains bison in North America with over 95% of the total population maintained for commercial production. In 2004, the Canadian Bison Association reported a population of 240,000 plains bison on 1,900 commercial farms, which are generating more than $50 million in bison sales annually.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-03-22" lims:fid="612006" lims:id="612006" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has supported bison ranching as an important diversification of the livestock industry.

From a genetic perspective, wild and ranched herds cannot be readily distinguished from one another, as the original stock for all existing bison herds in Canada came from private herds descended from the few wild bison remaining in the late 1800s. AAFC and the Canadian Bison Association have stated that listing the plains bison could lead to lower consumer demand for bison products which would be detrimental to the Canadian bison industry.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2006-03-22" lims:fid="612009" lims:id="612009" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Text>By not listing the plains bison, the species will not receive the protection and recovery measures afforded by the <XRefExternal reference-type="act" link="S-15.3">Species at Risk Act</XRefExternal> (the Act).
