because ammonium nitrate is usually stored in very large quantities, it has the potential to escalate an ordinary fire into an event approaching disaster proportions and for this reason, even a very small probability of occurrence cannot be ignored;</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph lims:inforce-start-date="2006-03-22" lims:fid="495944" lims:id="495944"><Label>(c)</Label><Text>it is important that ammonium nitrate be adequately separated from combustible materials and that the risk of fire be kept at as low a level as practicable;</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph lims:inforce-start-date="2006-03-22" lims:fid="495945" lims:id="495945"><Label>(d)</Label><Text>mixed fertilizers containing not more than 60 per cent ammonium nitrate as the only oxidizing material, with the balance as inert material, are not usually considered to be either a fire or an explosion hazard in storage; but certain additives or diluents may render even mixed fertilizers as hazardous or more hazardous than pure ammonium nitrate; for this reason, the exemption of a mixed fertilizer from compliance with the requirements of the Commission will depend on the nature and quantities of the ingredients in the mixture;</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph lims:inforce-start-date="2006-03-22" lims:fid="495946" lims:id="495946"><Label>(e)</Label><Text>it has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments that when the decomposition gases are sufficiently confined, they will accelerate or otherwise promote the decomposition reaction;
