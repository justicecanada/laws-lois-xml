persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities by giving effect to the principle that employment equity means more than treating persons in the same way but also requires special measures and the accommodation of differences.</Text><HistoricalNote><HistoricalNoteSubItem lims:inforce-start-date="2017-12-12" lims:fid="215139" lims:id="215139">1995, c. 44, s. 2; 2017, c. 26, s.
