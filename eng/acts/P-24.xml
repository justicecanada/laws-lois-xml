The salaries and emoluments so paid may be taxed by the Party concerned but shall be exempted from taxation by any other Party. If such an arrangement is entered into by any Party to the present Protocol and is subsequently modified or terminated, Parties to the present Protocol shall no longer be bound under the first sentence of this paragraph to exempt from taxation the salaries and emoluments paid to their nationals.</Text></Provision></Group><Group lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417039" lims:id="1417039"><GroupHeading lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417040" lims:id="1417040" format-ref="group2-division"><TitleText>Article 8</TitleText></GroupHeading><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417041" lims:id="1417041" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Label>1</Label><Text>For the purpose of facilitating the establishment, construction, maintenance and operation of Allied Headquarters, these Headquarters shall be relieved, so far as practicable, from duties and taxes, affecting expenditures by them in the interest of common defence and for their official and exclusive benefit, and each Party to the present Protocol shall enter into negotiations with any Allied Headquarters operating in its territory for the purpose of concluding an agreement to give effect to this provision.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417042" lims:id="1417042" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Label>2</Label><Text>An Allied Headquarters shall have the rights granted to a force under Article XI of the Agreement subject to the same conditions.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417043" lims:id="1417043" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Label>3</Label><Text>The provisions in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article XI of the Agreement shall not apply to nationals of the receiving States, unless such nationals belong to the armed services of a Party to this Protocol other than the receiving State.</Text></Provision><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417044" lims:id="1417044" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Label>4</Label><Text>The expression ‘duties and taxes’ in this Article does not include charges for services rendered.</Text></Provision></Group><Group lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417045" lims:id="1417045"><GroupHeading lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417046" lims:id="1417046" format-ref="group2-division"><TitleText>Article 9</TitleText></GroupHeading><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417047" lims:id="1417047" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Text>Except in so far as the North Atlantic Council may decide otherwise,</Text><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2023-06-22" lims:enacted-date="2023-06-22" lims:fid="1417048" lims:id="1417048" format-ref="indent-1-1" language-align="no" list-item="no"><Label>(a)</Label><Text>any assets acquired from the international funds of an Allied Headquarters under its capital budget and no longer required by the Headquarters shall be disposed of under arrangements approved by the North Atlantic Council and the proceeds shall be distributed among or credited to the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty in the proportions in which they have contributed to the capital costs of the Headquarters.
