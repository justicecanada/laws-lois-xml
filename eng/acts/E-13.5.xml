The Board of Directors may waive to such extent and upon such conditions as it may determine any of the immunities, privileges and exemptions conferred under this Chapter in cases where such action would, in its opinion, be appropriate in the best interests of the Bank. The President shall have the right and the duty to waive any immunity, privilege or exemption in respect of any officer, employee or expert of the Bank, other than the President or a Vice-President, where, in his or her opinion, the immunity, privilege or exemption would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the Bank. In similar circumstances and under the same conditions, the Board of Directors shall have the right and the duty to waive any immunity, privilege or exemption in respect of the President and each Vice-President.</Text></Provision></Group></Group><Group lims:inforce-start-date="2013-09-12" lims:fid="178514" lims:id="178514"><GroupHeading lims:inforce-start-date="2013-09-12" lims:fid="178515" lims:id="178515" format-ref="group1-part"><Label>CHAPTER IX</Label><TitleText>Amendments, Interpretation, Arbitration</TitleText></GroupHeading><Group lims:inforce-start-date="2013-09-12" lims:fid="178516" lims:id="178516"><GroupHeading lims:inforce-start-date="2013-09-12" lims:fid="178517" lims:id="178517" format-ref="group2-division"><Label>Article 56</Label><TitleText>Amendments</TitleText></GroupHeading><Provision lims:inforce-start-date="2013-09-12" lims:fid="178518" lims:id="178518" format-ref="indent-0-0" language-align="yes" list-item="no"><Label>1</Label><Text>Any proposal to amend this Agreement, whether emanating from a member, a Governor or the Board of Directors, shall be communicated to the Chairman of the Board of Governors who shall bring the proposal before that Board.
